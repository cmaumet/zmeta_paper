IBMA notes


In this tbx we want:
ok- Stouffer's FFX (and RFX)
ok- Fishers
- weighted Fishers?
ok- z-weighted by sqrt(n_i)
ok- hierarchical 3rd-level FFX (WLS)

ok- OLS on cope (is MFX !!!)


- permutation on z's ??
- permutation FFX (and see how well it behave)

TODO:
- create stouffers.mat to detect if an analysis has already been computed in there
- ask to overwrite analysis and if yes delete previous files
- FFX OLS is not practical for meta-analysis (as we would need to store the original subject data) unless a cross-subjects cross-study variance estimate is shared which is not practical either... Are there other solutions ??


done
- Stouffers FFX and RFX
- you want to have a directory to store the results of an IBMA
- ecrire des tests


General tbx notes:
Cannot have a <tbxname>_cfg_<functionName> as common function for config
